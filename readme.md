# ChatBox 

ChatBox Test 


It is a simple ChatBox in which it has the function of answering your question, this is not a chat in which to chat between two or more people, improvements in them "maybe" would enable this function, otherwise the only for this as a prototype.


This code is for training and to increase the github portfolio, it is open source where anyone can use it and try to improve it

Thanks. :)
